            <h3>Quick Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                Hi! I'm Ethan and I'm currently a second year student at the
                University of Sussex studying Computer Science and Artificial
                intelligence.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I'm interested in quite a lot of things computer science, but my
                main interests revolve around Game Development, and Artificial
                Intelligence.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Why I picked Computer Science</h3>
            <p>
                I remember when I was a kid, my dad introduced me to the concepts
                of programming with Arduino. I was pretty excited about programming
                but could just not wrap my head around what it meant when the compiler
                kept saying that my variable needs to be declared, so I stopped trying
                to learn it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In high school, I was quite interested in physical Engineering. However, I felt
                like there was less opportunity to express my creativity in that field
                so I got more and more interested in computer science. Now I sometimes
                find myself coding for weeks and time would just whizz by.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>Hobbies</h3>
            <p>
                I would say that I'm a pretty creative person. I really like 
                creating things whether it's for me or for other people. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I spend a lot of time doing things like songwriting, singing and
                music production in my free time, as well as software development.
            </p>
            <h3>Where do I see myself in 10 years</h3>
            <p>
                I don't really know, but I definitely see myself making more cool stuff!
            </p>
