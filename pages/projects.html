          Unreal Engine Multiplayer FPS Project
        </h1>

        <div class="projectSection_description_div">
          <p>
            This is a project that I started in 2024 when I wanted to build a
            game inspired by the Battlefield series by Electronic Arts. Going
            into this, I knew that it would be quite challenging as I had never
            tried implementing replication in C++ before.
          </p>

          <h3>Locomotion and Interaction Replication</h3>

          <p>
            I managed to successfully implement replicated locomotion in the
            game. Although there are still quite a lot of things I need to
            polish off. I also managed to replicate interaction with objects
            such as doors. However, I found a bug where if you keep spamming
            interact, the replication will (although not very often) get out of
            sync. Unfortunately, that is an issue I do not yet know how to fix.
            Further down development, I will probably add a proning system in
            the game as well. I got most of my animations through the Unreal
            sample projects and mixamo.
          </p>

          <br />

          <button class="toggleMuteButton" onclick="muteVideo(LocomotionVideo)">
            Click for sound
          </button>

          <video autoplay loop muted id="LocomotionVideo">
            <source
              src="../videos/locomotionReplication.mp4"
              type="video/mp4"
            />
          </video>

          <h3>Creating Assets</h3>

          <p>
            Due to the lack of assets. Mostly because I couldn't find any on the
            web. I had to create some first person shooter animations for my
            game. I used the Unreal Engine 4 Mannequin Skeleton Control Rig to
            make these animations as the first person arms thankfully shared the
            same skeleton. I made some pistol idle, firing, and walking
            animations, but there are sitll a lot more animations I need to
            make. I also want to implement some 2 player animations further down
            the line, like stabbing animations.
          </p>

            <source src="../videos/makingAnimations.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>

          <h3>Menu System</h3>

          <p>
            I also created a simple game menu system using blueprints and UMG.
            The keybinds page allows you to change the keybindings using the
            Input Key Selector. I used Unreal Engine 5's Enhanced Input
            Subsystem for this project since the old Input Mapping system is
            deprecated. For the graphics section, I made a macro that utilizes
            some other custom functions to make my life easier when linking up
            all the nodes with the button events.
          </p>

          <br />

          <button class="toggleMuteButton" onclick="muteVideo(GameMenuVideo)">
            Click for sound
          </button>

          <video autoplay loop muted id="GameMenuVideo">
            <source src="../videos/gameMenuVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>

          <h3>Also this happened when I was retargeting animations</h3>

          <br />

          <button
            class="toggleMuteButton"
            onclick="muteVideo(RetargetingAnimationsVideo)"
          >
            Click for sound
          </button>

          <video autoplay loop muted id="RetargetingAnimationsVideo">
            <source
              src="../videos/retargetingAnimations.mp4"

      <section id="section_RLBM" class="projectSection">
        <h1 id="section_RLBM_title">Rocket League Broadcast Manager</h1>

        <div class="projectSection_description_div">
          <p>
            Rocket League Broadcast Manager is an evolving project aimed at
            simplifying and enhancing the broadcasting process for Rocket League
            esports matches. Crafted with a focus on practicality and
            efficiency, this tool caters to the needs of tournament organizers
            and broadcasters alike.
          </p>

          <h3>Intuitive Match Broadcasting</h3>

          <p>
            The application provides an easy-to-use interface for managing and
            broadcasting Rocket League events, ensuring a straightforward
            experience for users involved in esports broadcasting.
          </p>

          <h3>Structured Database Management</h3>

          <p>
            At its core, the project employs a well-organized database powered
            by Apache and MySQL. This database efficiently stores information
            about teams, matchups, and players, facilitating quick retrieval
            during broadcasts.
          </p>

          <h3>Real-Time Broadcast Overlays</h3>

          <p>
            A notable feature is the capability to generate real-time broadcast
            overlays. By pulling live data from the database, the application
            seamlessly integrates information into the overlay, offering viewers
            up-to-the-minute details on teams, matchups, and player statistics.
            As well as extra screens like a waiting screen showing match details
            and previews. Here is the overlay in action for the 2023 Sussex vs 
            Brighton Varsity event with me casting the match :D
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            The series score is a little bugged though, or could be a human input
            error :(
          </p>
          <br>
          
          <iframe
            width="800"
            height="450"
            src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_lxrAk-mANE?si=PEc3rcQpg7iUu5OK"

            frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
            allowfullscreen
          ></iframe>

          <br/>



          <h3>Statistical Tracking for Teams and Players</h3>

          <p>
            Beyond basic broadcasting, the application includes a statistics
            tracking system. It maintains a record of team and player
            performance across multiple broadcasted games, providing valuable
            insights into trends and achievements.
          </p>

          <h3>Instant Replays</h3>

          <p>
            Another feature I am planning to implement is instant replay.
            Electron can be used to capture audio and video from the computer.
            This means the program can stitch replays together, allowing users
            to play a highlight reel at the end of matches.
          </p>

          <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
          <h4>Backend</h4>

          <p>
            Utilizes Apache and MySQL for robust and secure database management.
          </p>

          <h4>Frontend</h4>

          <p>
            Developed using HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a
            responsive and visually appealing user interface.
          </p>

          <h4>Application Framework</h4>

          <p>
            Powered by Electron, offering a cross-platform desktop application
            for accessibility.
