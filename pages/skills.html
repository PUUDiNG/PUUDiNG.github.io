              This is the language we used at uni in our first year. So I've
              spent the most time on this language.

            <p>
              I gave it a 70% because I think there are definitely things that
              I'm less familiar with, such as lambda expressions.

              I recently started learning this through YouTube tutorials in my
              own time. I'm also quite interested in things like Game Engine
              programming in C++, and I think that's definitely something I will
              start learning in the near future.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Because of the language's complexity, I rated my proficiency in
              C++ at 45%. While I can produce code in C++ that matches what I
              can achieve in Java, I think that there's room for improvement in
              optimizing my code, especially given the greater control over
              memory in C++. Learning about compilers in my 3rd uni semester
              definitely helped a lot in my understanding.

              I learnt this from my databases course during my second year at
              uni. I found it quite useful when I was developing the Rocket
              League Broadcast Manager when I was using it to pull and push

              I first started learning this language in high school but I never
              really used it that much since I thought that it was a bit slow
              for most of my personal projects. I used it a bit more in my
              second year in my Natural Language Engineering module. Over the
              next few months I plan on spending more time on this language.

              I put my skill in Python at a 40% because it's more of a library
              oriented language and I think that a higher skill rating should
              mean that I know how to use more libraries.

              quite...Interesting. But I am able to use it fine with help from

              I don't do the Computing with Digital Media course at my uni, but
              game development was always something I wanted to do. So I learnt
              how to use this through online courses on YouTube and Udemy. I am
              able to do basic Blueprint and C++ programming in UE5. You can

              Modificiations, procedural generation, world partitioning, game

              I first learnt how to use Blender during the pandemic. And I made
              a donut, probably like everyone else. I know how to model basic
              objects in hard surface modelling, but have a bit of a hard time
              with complex smooth round surfaces and good topology. I also know
              the basics of how Normals and UVs work which helped me with my
              learning in Unreal. I'm not that proficient at using nodes in
              Blender yet but it is a skill I'd like to get better at in the
              future. Especially geometry nodes for procedural generation.

              I started learning how to produce music in 2018 and have been
              doing it consistently since. I would say that I'm quite familiar
              with FL Studio but to really push that 90% mark, I need to
              understand the more technical aspects such as creating complex
